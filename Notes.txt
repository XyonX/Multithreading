we can create a tread by using :  std:std::thread ThreadName (Calling_Function_Namw)

we can join a thread by calling ThreadName .join() function

we can check if a thread is joinable or not by checking ThreadName.joinable()

once a tread is in the joinable state is must be join or detach

join function stops the execution of  tha calling thread and then passes the execution to the joined thread

after joined thread  execution is done  it again returns the execution to the callign thread

join () - it pauses the main execution
Detach ()- it does the execution in parallel with the main thread
